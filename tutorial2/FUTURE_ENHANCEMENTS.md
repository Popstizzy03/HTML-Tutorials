# Future Enhancements for Emoji Picker

This document lists potential future enhancements and feature requests for the Emoji Picker application (Tutorial 2).

## Collaboration Features
- **Real-time Chat:** Integrate a chat functionality allowing multiple users to communicate.
- **Collaborative Code Editing:** Explore possibilities for users to work on a shared codebase or text area within the application.
- **Database Integration:** Implement a simple database backend to support user accounts, saved states for collaboration, and persistent chat messages. Consider technologies like Firebase or a lightweight Node.js backend with SQLite/PostgreSQL.

## Design and Planning Tools
- **Wireframing/App Planner Integration:** Add a simple tool or integrate an existing one to allow users to create wireframes or plan UI/UX directly within the application. This could help in visualizing changes or new features.
- **Customizable Color Palettes:** While the UI will be updated with a professional palette, allow users to select from a predefined list or create and save their own color schemes for the application.

## Notes
These features represent significant additions and would require substantial development effort, including backend infrastructure and potentially complex frontend logic. They are currently logged as long-term goals for the project.
